How to use:
	1º:Create a object for the button:
		EX: debounce button = debounce(PIN,PRESSED_STATE)
		>"PIN" is the Arduino terminal on which the button
		>"PRESSED_STATE" is the logical state when button is pressed(HIGH or LOW)
		Tip: using "LOW" for "PRESSED_STATE" the pin is defined as INPUT_PULL,not requiring an adjusting resistor for the button.

	2ºRead the status for the button:
		EX: button.read()
		Its return 1(true) if the button is pressed(button is pressed when the logical signal on the button pin is equal to "PRESSES_STATE").
